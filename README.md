# Exploratory plugin for FFXIV

## Mostly just learning how to write plugins, but:

### Ultimately trying to make camera movement more natural-feeling:

-   for a neutral zoom distance and while looking forward, camera should pitch to keep player's feet in frame, but not much behind them
-   when aiming up, camera should also pitch up along its own local axis; this allows looking up at things without the camera pushing against the floor and the WoL blocking the view
-   an option such that, when flying, player can see below them without pitching the mount downward
